# Why Tidyverse

---
class:  middle

# Tidy data

- Structured data sets are **easier** to manipulate, model, and visualize

- Rows are observations
- Columns are variables


---
class: middle

# R/RStudio/Tidyverse

- A Reproducible Scripting Ecosystem

    - Projects are local folder-directories and can be Git repositories
    - RMarkdown enables literate coding
    - RMarkdown enables reproducible reporting (Word, PowerPoint, and **much, much** more)
    
---
class: middle

# Literate Programing

- Separate code from prose
- R Notebooks (just one example)

---
class: middle

# Let's Get Started

- Rstudio IDE

    - Console
    - Import Files
    - Script Editor
    - Packages
    - Help
    
- Tidyverse Package
