# What is R

---
class: middle

- A statistical programming language developed in the early 90s

    - Derived from the S language (mid 70s)
    
- RStudio - a free IDE:  make it easier to program in R 

- Tidyverse - An opinionated set of packages for data science

    - Easiest to learn a consistent set of packages
    - Good documentation:  https://www.tidyverse.org/

# Why Tidyverse

---
class:  middle

# Tidy data

- Structured data sets are **easier** to manipulate, model, and visualize

- Rows are observations
- Columns are variables


---
class: middle

# R/RStudio/Tidyverse

- A Reproducible Scripting Ecosystem

    - Projects are local folder-directories and can be Git repositories
    - RMarkdown enables literate coding
    - RMarkdown enables reproducible reporting (Word, PowerPoint, and **much, much** more)
    
---
class: middle

# Literate Programing

- Separate code from prose
- R Notebooks (just one example)

---
class: middle, center, duke-softblue

# Common Questions

---
class: middle, center

# Assignment

Create an object using a name

## `<-`
alt-dash

"gets value from"

`answer <- 5 * 5`

---
class: middle, center

# Pipe

Chain functions together (a tidyverse or magritter conjunction)

## `%>%`  
Ctrl/Cmd-Shift-M

"and then"

`answer %>% sqrt()`
