This is an [R Notebook](https://rmarkdown.rstudio.com/r_notebooks.html) illustrating [literate programming](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Literate_programming) techniques with code **inside** *code chunks*.  Outside the code chunks you can write your prose to explain your goals, workflow, provenance, and code.  You can enhance your prose with [R Markdown](http://rmarkdown.rstudio.com/)). 

You can execute code within the R Notebook. Results appear beneath the code.  R Markdown documents can be rendered into many formats including MS Word, Power Point, slides, web pages, web sites, and more. 

Try executing the code chunk, below, by clicking the green-arrow *Run* button (within the chunk), or by placing your cursor inside the chunk and pressing *Ctrl+Shift+Enter.*


```{r}
plot(cars)
```

Add a new chunk by clicking the *Insert Chunk* button on the toolbar or by pressing *Ctrl+Alt+I*.

When you save the notebook, an HTML file containing the code and output will be saved alongside it (click the *Preview* button or press *Ctrl+Shift+K* to preview the HTML file).

The preview shows you a rendered HTML copy of the contents of the editor. Consequently, unlike *Knit*, *Preview* does not run any R code chunks. Instead, the output of the chunk when it was last run in the editor is displayed.

*Ctrl+Shift+M*:  Generates a pipe -- ` %>% ` -- between functions (When you use the `tidyerse` package.)
